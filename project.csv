08-25-2025,AI Resume Matcher,"This project implements an end-to-end resume intelligence stack: it ingests raw PDF/Word resumes, uses OCR and LLMs to convert them into structured JSON, classifies skills via a curated taxonomy, and stores everything in Supabase. It provides a Next.js admin console for uploading resumes/positions, filtering and managing matches, and visualizing matching analytics. Additionally, it includes a matching service that ranks candidates for job positions and writes results back to the database.

05-20-2025,OhCat,"ohcat is a Next.js “Talking Character” app for the Ohcat brand, offering virtual smart pets that chat, emote, and join real-time voice calls using Volcano Engine’s RTC + AIGC stack. It features a multi-tab UI (Home, Market, Chat, Circle, Care, Settings), a cat showroom, conversational sandbox, voice chat with synchronized animation, and audio queueing. The backend consists of a Koa proxy server that issues RTC tokens and forwards AIGC OpenAPI requests, with configurable models, TTS/ASR, and persona prompts per cat.",https://github.com/Antony957/ohcat,project_content/ohcat.png
03-15-2025,Unraveling LLM Jailbreaks Through Safety Knowledge Neurons,"Prior defenses against jailbreaks often lack clear rationale. We introduce a neuron-level method that identifies and adjusts safety-related knowledge neurons, achieving over 97% control effectiveness. Based on this, our SafeTuning strategy strengthens these neurons, significantly lowering attack success rates and outperforming existing defenses.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01631,project_content/SafetyKnowledge.jpg
12-15-2024,Defending against Jailbreak through Early Exit Generation,"Recent work shows that LLM alignment can be bypassed through jailbreak techniques. We observe that jailbreak prompts resemble malicious inputs in early embeddings, even if their outputs look benign. Based on this, we propose EEG-Defender, which detects such inputs from early transformer layers and reduces attack success rates by ~85% with minimal utility loss.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11308,project_content/EEG.jpg
